<p>1) KEYLOGGING(SPYWARE)
    We created a keylogger that is inserted in a picture or document file for Windows computers. The keylogger operates in the background when the file is accessed, recording keystrokes and transmitting them to our server. Every three mouse clicks also result in a screenshot being taken, which is then sent to our server. Since Python is used throughout the project, it demonstrates our proficiency with both programming and cybersecurity.
